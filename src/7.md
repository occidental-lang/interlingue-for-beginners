### 3

The negative is formed by using `ne` before the verb. In accordance with widespread usage double negatives may be used.

| Ie | En |
| --- | --- |
| Yo ne ama la. Noi ne ha videt li post-officie. It (ne) esset videt nequande. | I do not love her. We did not see the post office. It was not seen anywhere. |

### 4

Questions are asked by prefixing the word `esque` to the sentence or by using a specific interrogative, e.g. :

| Ie | En |
| --- | --- |
| Esque vu posse exchangear li libre? | Can you exchange the book? |
| Qui observat li heroic action? | Who saw the heroic action? |
| Quo es li nómine del dormient puella? | What is the name of the sleeping girl? |
| Qual picturas es trovat in li chambre? | What kind of pictures are (found) in the room? |
| De qui es li rubi chapel? | Whose is the red hat? |

### 5

Note that `quo` means "what" (thing) and that `qui` (who) is applied to persons only ; `quel` means "which" or "who" ; `quem` means "whom". These words can be used as relatives.

| Ie | En |
| --- | --- |
| Ella dit que li mann qui (or quel) auxiliat la mey revenir. | She said that the man who helped her should come back. |
| Vu prendet li moné quel yo mettet in li tiruore. | You took the money which I put in the drawer. |

A plural form `queles` may be used if desired, e.g. :

| Ie | En |
| --- | --- |
| Li erras quel (or queles) vu ha fat. | The errors that you have made. |

Note the method of forming comparatives and superlatives.

| Ie | En |
| --- | --- |

| Vu tene li max(im) odorant rose in vor manu. | You are holding the sweetest smelling rose in your hand. |
| Yo es tam fort quam il. | I am as strong as he. |
| Un bellissim raconta. | A very lovely story. |

### 7 

`Ti` means "this", "that", "these" or "those". If really necessary we can add `ci` for "this, these" and `ta` for "that, those".

| Ie | En |
| --- | --- |
| Ti págine es li ultim. | This (that) page is the last. |
| Ti-ci flore es blu ma ti-ta es rubi. | This flower is blue, but that one is red. |

As a noun we use `to`.

| --- | --- |
