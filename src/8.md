## Lesson 8

### 1

We have seen that nouns can be formed from the participles of verbs, e.g. "viagear" (to travel), "viageante" (traveller). This indicates an action at the time. For more habitual or professional action we use `-or` or `-ero` added to the perfect stem.

| Word | Derivative |
| --- | --- |
| administrar | administrator |
| navigar | navigator |
| picter | pictor |
| molinar | molinero |

This suffix indicates an instrument too, e.g., "acumulator".

### 2

The suffix `-ist` corresponds to a follower of a system, dogma, idea or person.

> social, socialist ; Deo (God), deist ; lingue, linguist.
