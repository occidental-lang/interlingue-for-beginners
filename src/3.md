## Lesson 3

### 1

The personal pronouns are

| Yo | tu | il | ella | it | noi | vu | ili |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I | thou | he | she | it | we | you | they |

### 2

As the object of a verb the following forms are used

| Me | te | le | la | it | nos | vos | les |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Me | thee | him | her | it | us | you | them |

> Yo ama la (I love her), ella ama me (she loves me).

### 3 

These forms can also be used for the indirect object :

> Il da me li lettre (he gives me the letter).

If both the direct and indirect objects are pronouns, the latter comes first.

> Il da me it (he gives it to me).

### 4 

After a preposition we use the object forms except for the third person, when "se" is used.

| Ie | En |
| --- | --- |
| Yo lava me | I wash myself |
| Il lava se | He washes himself |
| Noi lava nos | We wash ourselves |

### 5 

The possessives are :

| Mi | tu(i) | su | nor (or nostri) | vor (or vostri) | lor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| My | thy | his/her/its | our | your | their |


> Lor paccage es apert.

### 6 

Some common prepositions are :

| Ie | En |
| --- | --- |
| ante | before (time) |
| ínter | between |
| a | at |
| circa | around |
| avan | before (place) |
| súper | above |
| tra | through |
| trans | across |
| in | in |

### 7

The feminine is indicated in three ways :

a) by using a different word

> púer (boy), puella (girl)

> bove (ox), vacca (cow)

b) by the suffix `-essa` :

> poete, poetessa

> leon, leonessa

c) by the ending `a`. In this case we indicate the masculine by `-o` and the neutral by `-e`:

> Simie, simia, simio (monkey)
